DIY magnetic shifter mod for the Fanatec Clubsport Formula Rim

The fitting of the two 10mm magnets is not perfect, if I find some time, I'll rework the part1.
For me, the feeling is more then enough as it is.

4 10x3mm round magnets needed in total (2 for each side)

I printed everything without supports, worked fine.
